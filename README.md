# Name of Project: 
  Animal Sounds


# Description: 
  Using OOP, it contains animals created and managed as objects which display the sound they make in text when clicked.

# Note: 
This is a side project I am doing for personal practice and for my nephews to try out.  I have it mapped out on paper, but the code is clearly in early stages of development.
